;; Selectors
;;
;; Note: Selectors are functions of a zipper location that return a zipper
;; location if a node satisfies their requirements, or nil if it does not.
;; In general, the location returned should be "the location that satisfied
;; the requirement," although what exactly that means is specific to the
;; selector. Probably most selectors should return the same location passed
;; in, though. Exceptions would be selectors for properties of ancestors,
;; siblings, etc.

;; They do not execute in the environment
;; of the template; that is, your template arguments are not available. Thus,
;; selections must be based entirely on properties of the template itself.
